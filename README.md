# Airsoft-Chronograph
update: Prototype is working but not all features are done. Project isn't currently being worked on. You can take a look at my schematics and board and possibly build it yourself.

I am making an Airsoft Chronograph which uses 3D printed parts and an arduino nano as the brains. 
The chronograph will have multiple features such as:

Normalized fps (fps if it were a 0.20g bb)

Average fps

Rate of Fire

Min/Max FPS

Max deviation
